Level 2 can have moving platform obstacles, maybe a train passing the road or clearing a highway crossy road style
Level 3 can have difficult race track with obstacles and chasing enemies

boss level where the car just goes to the right, animation up and down only goes bottom right and top right
dodging an enemy for an amount of time?

I rlly want to do an ai racer enemy type

things u might need to do:
- redo the tilesheet to add more tiles
- fix the animation for the car bottom right
- fix audio and music
- make the finish line and path to victory more obvious
	maybe just a text intro? How to Play scene
- SHADER EFFECTS??

FINAL GAME STRUCTURE:
- 3 levels
	level 1: one chaser, 60 second time limit, race track
	level 2: several blockers, 45 second time limit, race track
	level 3: enemy racer, no time limit, simple race track against perfect AI

- playground (OPTIONAL)
	large level with a bunch of chasers and blockers
